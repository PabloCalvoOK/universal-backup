## How to design a platform to include all application types

If we want to achieve adequate data protection in the cloud, it is necessary to take into account four different aspects; 

The first of these is the cloud provider, which is the one who provides the infrastructure where the data is hosted. 

We must realize that there may be more than one cloud provider in a complex customer installation; each of these cloud providers markets different types of applications in three modalities: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

The platform must allow adding new cloud providers to the backup platform according to the client's wishes with all the procedures validation and discovery of resources of this provider.
