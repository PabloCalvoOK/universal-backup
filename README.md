# Cloud data protection


## How to design a platform to include all application types

If we want to achieve adequate data protection in the cloud, it is necessary to take into account four different aspects; 

The first of these is the **cloud provider**, which is the one who provides the infrastructure where the data is hosted. 

We must realize that there may be more than one cloud provider in a complex customer installation; each of these cloud providers markets different types of applications in three modalities: software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

The platform must allow adding new cloud providers to the backup platform according to the client's wishes with all the procedures validation and discovery of resources of this provider.

These providers or third-party manufacturers provide applications;  we will call these applications use cases; a use case is a  business application chosen by an organization to process its data. 

A robust data protection system must learn all the new applications that a customer decides to move to the cloud of their choice (cloud providers). Only the option remains to understand automatically or semi-automatically what further data is generated by which application they must protect. So from now on, we must know where and how the information is stored and how it is generated so that we can take a copy and restore it, respecting the complete business logic of the application.

The way to access the data will give rise to our access methods.

All this data must be stored within a backup platform that includes a backup machine and a repository where the copies are stored. In this way, we will have a single storage with all the backup records of our client, and there may be a platform for each cloud provider to reduce costs related to backup traffic between different cloud providers. The backup machine and the repository must have deduplication features to minimize storage and traffic costs between components.

Once we have the chosen backup solution, we will take advantage of some of the features that have been developed for a long time by the industry in this software product type; among them, we can name data compression and deduplication. 

A more detailed list of features that a "traditional" backup solution should have includes the following features:


Air-gapping to protect against ransomware attacks.

- Centralized Backup that supports a large number of data and computes environments.

- Integrated Deduplication to eliminate duplicate copies of repeating data

- The security includes encryption, lockbox access control, and a robust user authentication method.

- Performance that ensures fast copies.

- Replication to protect against disasters.
